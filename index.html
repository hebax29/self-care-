        <h2>What Is Self-Care?</h2>
        <p class="firstp">Self-care is the practice of individuals looking after their own health using the knowledge
            and information available to them. It is a decision-making process that empowers individuals to look after
            their own health efficiently and conveniently, in collaboration with health and social care professionals as
            needed. Unfortunately, however, many people view self-care as a luxury, rather than a priority.
            Consequently, they're left feeling overwhelmed, tired, and ill-equipped to handle life's inevitable
            challenges. But It's important to assess how you're caring for yourself in several different domains so you
            can ensure you're caring for your mind, body, and spirit.</p>

        <h2>Physical Self-Care</h2>
        <p>You need to take care of your body if you want it to run efficiently. Keep in mind that there's a strong
            connection between your body and your mind. When you're caring for your body, you'll think and feel better
            too. Physical self-care includes how you're fueling your body, how much sleep you're getting, how much
            physical activity you are doing, and how well you're caring for your physical needs. Attending healthcare
            appointments, taking medication as prescribed, and managing your health are all part of good physical
            self-care.</p> <br>
        <p>When it comes to physical self-care, ask yourself the following questions to assess whether there might be
            some areas you need to improve:

            Are you getting adequate sleep?
            Is your diet fueling your body well?
            Are you taking charge of your health?
            Are you getting enough exercise? </p> <br>

        <h2>Mental Self-Care</h2>
        <p>The way you think and the things that you're filling your mind with greatly influence your psychological
            well-being.

            Mental self-care includes doing things that keep your mind sharp, like puzzles, or learning about a subject
            that fascinates you. You might find reading books or watching movies that inspire you fuels your mind.4

            Mental self-care also involves doing things that help you stay mentally healthy. Practicing self-compassion
            and acceptance, for example, helps you maintain a healthier inner dialogue.</p>
